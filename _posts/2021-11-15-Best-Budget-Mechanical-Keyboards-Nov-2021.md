The first and (in our opinion) the best on our list is the **Redragon K552**

The **Redragon K552-RGB** is a great choice for budget gamers. It sports red switches which have great tactile feedback. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this keyboard for the price.

We sincerely recommend it if you want a quality keyboard for little money.

Pros:

- Great build quality for the price (aluminium base)
- Includes all function keys

Cons:
- USB cable is hard-wired
